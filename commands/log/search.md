# `/log search`

The `/log search` command takes a text query and compares it against events logged in your guild. The query can be a user id, role id, event name, pretty much anything. Results will be formatted as a list, and the identifiers can then be used in [`/log lookup`](https://apollo.swvn.io/commands/log/lookup.html)

*In the future this command will be made to be more granular for retreiving more specific information and analytics*
